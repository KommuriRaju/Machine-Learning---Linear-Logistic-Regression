**Linear Regression:

There is a Ecommerce company which sells Clothing online as well as in store facility to give style and clothing advice sessions.

With this customers used to come for advice then go back to home and order products through app or website.

Now, company would like to know whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.

It's my responsibility to help them figure out. The Following steps I followed and for detailed project please look at the **notebook**.

Since the data set is completely fine, we can directly jump in to the EDA.

**Logistic Regression:**

For This Logistic Regression I've done 3 projects.
1. Term Deposit - Bank
2. Customer Classification
3. Titanic - Survival

**Term Deposit:**
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution.
The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit.

**Customer Classification**


**Introduction:**
This project is a retail banking institution.
They are going to float a stock trading facility for their existing customers.
The idea is to use data to classify whether a customer belongs to a high net worth or low net worth group.
They will have to incentivize their customers to adopt their offerings.
One way to incentivize is to offer discounts on the commission for trading transactions.

**Current Scenario:**
The company rolled out this service to about 10,000+ of its customers and observed their trading behavior for 6 months and after that, they labeled them into two revenue grids 1 and 2.

**Problem Statement:**
The current process suffers from the following problems:

One issue is that only about 10% of the customers do enough trades for earnings after discounts to be profitable.

The company wants to figure out, which are those 10% customers so that it can selectively offer them a discount.

The marketing department want to supplement their campaigns with a more proactive approach with our solution.


**Titanic - Survival**

This project to predict the survival rate of the passengers who were onboarded to Ttanic ship in different class.
